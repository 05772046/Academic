abstract: Several members of the sirtuin (SIRT) family, a highly conserved
  family of NAD+-dependent enzymes, have been shown to play a critical role in
  both promoting and/or suppressing tumorigenesis. In this study, recent
  progress in the field concerning SIRT4 and cancer was reviewed, and the
  relationship between SIRT4 and tumors was investigated. Subsequently, we
  evaluated the role of SIRT4 with oncogenic or tumor-suppressive activity in
  cancer, which may provide insight in identifying the underlying mechanism of
  action of SIRT4 in cancer. Finally, we explored the potential of SIRT4 as a
  therapeutic target in cancer therapy.
